            Hello! My name is Andrew Ashland, and I am a Cleveland based web-developer. I've been learning and improving my web-development skills for around a year. I am now ready to make a career of it. I have a molecular biology degree from Kent State University. Since graduating I've worked in multiple aerospace repair facitities.  In one I was a lab technician, and the other an EHS coordinator and lab and plating department supervisor.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p text-indent="10px" class="my_info">
            I have tried to develop a well-rounded set of skills, from UX design, to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to building full-stack MVC web apps with .NET and C#.
